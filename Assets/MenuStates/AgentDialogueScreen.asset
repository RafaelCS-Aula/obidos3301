  _dialogueText: 'Narrator: According to all known laws of aviation, there is no
    way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little
    body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don''t care
    what humans think is impossible.  (Barry is picking out a shirt)  Barry: Yellow,
    black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let''s
    shake it up a little.  Janet: Barry! Breakfast is ready!  Barry: Coming! Hang
    on a second.  (Barry uses his antenna like a phone)  Barry: Hello  (Through phone) 
    Adam: Barry?  Barry: Adam?  Adam: Can you believe this is happening?  Barry:
    I can''t. I''ll pick you up.  (Barry flies down the stairs)  Martin: Looking
    sharp.  Janet: Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.'
