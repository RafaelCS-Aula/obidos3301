  _dialogueText: " The  Industrial  Revolution  and  its  consequences  have  been 
    a  disaster  for  the  human  race.  They  have  greatly  increased  the life-expectancy
    of those of us who live in \u201Cadvanced\u201D countries, but they have destabilized
    society, have made life unfulfilling, have  subjected  human  beings  to  indignities, 
    have  led  to  widespread  psychological  suffering  (in  the  Third  World 
    to  physical suffering  as  well)  and  have  inflicted  severe  damage  on 
    the  natural  world.  The  continued  development  of  technology  will worsen
    the situation. It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities and
    inflict greater damage on the natural world, it  will  probably  lead  to  greater 
    social disruption  and  psychological  suffering,  and  it  may  lead  to  increased 
    physical  suffering even in \u201Cadvanced\u201D countries"
